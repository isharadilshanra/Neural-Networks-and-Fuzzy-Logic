    "In particular, we will classify images of handwritten digits ($0, 1, 2, \\cdots, 9$). For example, given a set of handwritten digit images that only contain two digits (Eg: $1$ and $5$) the model will classify the images based on the written digit.\n",
    "\n",

Given test images (3 dimensional numpy array that contains $28 \\times 28$ digit images) it will correctly recognize the written digits between d1 and d2. You can assume that test_images will only contain images of digits d1 and d2. Inside predict you would need to preprocess the images using vectorize, predict the correct labels using model and then output the correct lables. Output should be a vector predicted of d1's and d2's, predicted[i] should correspond to the test_image[i]."
